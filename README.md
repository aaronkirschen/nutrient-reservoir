# nutrient-reservoir
This is a ESPHOME / HomeAssistant nutrient reservoir. Not everything works perfectly but it has been mixing nutrients for my garden fairly well for the past several years.

# How to set up
Mine has been cobbled together with a wemos c1 mini module. You will need to update the code a bit as needed for your own setup. I don't have a circuit diagram but it should be easy enough to figure out based on the code... I have planned on designed a circuit board but my 'prototype' has worked pretty well and I have not designed the board yet.

# Issues
AFAIK everything is working great except for the nutrient concentrate remaining percent. I'm pretty sure it gets resets when the unit turns off, should be an easy fix just need to store the current percent correctly but I haven't taken the time to look.
